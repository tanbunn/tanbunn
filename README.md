I write and roleplay often (on both roblox and minecraft, mostly minecraft though) and I have written two fantasy worlds of my own, one I made with my lover :) All of my characters are personally fleshed out with deep lores and lots of thought put into them!! The characters I use most often are
Grimrose - A haunted, ritualist deer-man :) I use him most during myth hunts but most commonly in Lostcoin
Aureliano - An angel-born to just be a king, he shows it in his actions too! I use him often in lostcoin as the king of Suncrest
Stellan - (Lostcoin AU at least): A teenage boy who’s determined to rebel against the government along with his bestfriend, they often hunt together as species hunters
Winslie - A wolf girl who fucks around and finds out, I use her a lot in Lostcoin for lighthearted, fun lore

These are just the ones I use currently but this can and WILL change overtime!! I'll... see if I have the energy to update my carrd then ... or if I remember! either or I guess
